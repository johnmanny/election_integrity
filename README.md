# Election Integrity Webpage
Collaborative Project on Election Integrity Topics

## Authors:
Taylor Santos, John Nemeth

## Details
This project is a webserver (setup for heroku deployment) which demonstrates
a small-scale election and allows for voters to securely transmit their vote 
to different vote counters as well as verify the voting results.

It uses pip3, python3, Flask, and other associated resources.
To host the webserver, a python3 environment is created and server
requirements are installed in that environment. 

## Holding a vote
Voting must be done by first defining a vote through the administration page. 
The password is temporarily defined in the main flask server file.
