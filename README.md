# Election Integrity Webpage
Collaborative Project on Election Integrity Topics

## Details
This project hosts a webpage that hosts a small-scale election
and allows for voters to verify information securely. 

It uses pip3, python3, Flask, and other associated resources.
To host the webserver, a python3 environment is created and server
requirements are installed in that environment. 
## Launching Server
One command can be used to install all requirements and run the environment.

```
make run
```

## Holding a vote
Voting must be done by first defining a vote through the administration page. 
The password is temporarily defined in the main flask server file.
